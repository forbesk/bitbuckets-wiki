In the last 20 years, the internet has connected individuals in many professions. Software engineers in particular have devised ways to take advantage of this high degree of connectivity - namely, subversion and git allow many developers to work on a single codebase in tandem without stepping on each other's contributions and ensuring the final product executes as expected.

Mechanical engineers have also devised ways to tackle this same problem. Version control systems such as Solidworks PDM or GrabCAD allow us to work on different subsystems and retain a full development history.

The Bit Buckets use GrabCAD Workbench as it is free and cloud-based. The full project repository is stored on GrabCAD's servers and can be checked out using a local client application.
